// javaScript tries to be smarter sometimes and it tries to guess some error corrrection....whinch yout have to keep in  mind, exa.,

// (true + 3) will give output 4 coz true is considered as literal 1
// ('7' - 4) will give O\P 3 however 7 is written as a String
// ('7' + 4) will give O\P 74....yes this is how it get tricky sometimes

// js judge following values as false

// 0
// null
// ''  empty String
// undefined
// false
